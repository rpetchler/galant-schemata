## Variants

*The full Durante countermelody is ➎–➍–➌–➊–➐–➎–➊–➌, with two tones for each of
the four tones ➆–➀–➁–➂. Either voice may be placed in the bass.* (Gjerdingen
2007, 462)

The following examples feature the countermelody reduced to its bare
essentials, ➍–➌–➐–➊, and set in the bass. They resemble Ex. 16.10 in *Music in
the Galant Style* (Gjerdingen 2007, 232).

A repeated, pre-cadential Fenaroli.

The Fenaroli as a riposte to an opening theme. It lacks a pedal point on ➄ but
the chords in the first beat of each measure create a similar effect. An
embedded Comma reinforces a pre-cadential effect.
