## Variants

*A leaping type, in which the bass alternately leaps down a fourth and steps up
a second, all with 5/3 sonorities (the fourth of which was minor).* (Gjerdingen
2007, 454)

An incomplete leaping Romanesca. Truncating the schema after four events and
using ➄ instead of ➂ in the fourth event causes the schema to modulate to the
dominant. Because of this modulation, the fourth event lacks minor sonorities.

  "../../scores/w-a2/#1-allegro-di-molto"
>}}

A complete leaping Romanesca. The keyboard plays 5/3 sonorities in the
metrically weak events.

*A stepwise type, in which the bass descends entirely by step, with alternating
5/3 and 6/3 sonorities.* (Gjerdingen 2007, 454)

A Romanesca with a stepwise bass with a Prinner riposte. Arguably the first
measure of the Prinner constitutes the third measure of the Romanesca and thus
the schemata overlap.
