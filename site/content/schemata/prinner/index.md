## Examples

The Prinner as a riposte to a Romanesca with a stepwise bass. Arguably the
first measure of the Prinner constitutes the third measure of the Romanesca and
thus the schemata overlap.

The Prinner as riposte to a Romanesca in the galant style. The D-sharp in the
second beat of the Prinner is likely an error in the original score (Welcker
1765, 13); Henle uses a D-natural with an editorial accidental (Heinemann 1981,
18) and Ex. 2.23 in *Music in the Galant Style* uses a D-natural (Gjerdingen
2007, 41).

## Variants

*A type with a canon on ➏–➎–➍–➌ in melody and bass. There is usually a pedal
point on ➀, with ➍–➌ in the one part sounding against ➏–➎ in the other.*
