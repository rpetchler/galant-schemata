The Sol-Fa-Mi is the three-stage variety mentioned in the introduction to
Chapter 18 of *Music in the Galant Style* (Gjerdingen 2007, 253) rather than
the four-stage variety that is the focus of that chapter.

My favorite part of this movement is the Fenaroli / Converging Half Cadence in
the second half:

>}}

This is the Durante countermelody variant of the Fenaroli in which the
countermelody is reduced to its bare essentials, ➍–➌–➐–➊, and set in the bass.
The first Converging Half Cadence evades modulating to the dominant; the second
completes modulating and sets up a Cadenza.
