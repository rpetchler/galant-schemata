The major section uses a Do-Re-Mi as an opening gesture, and the minor section
uses an Aprile as a second theme. The first half of the major section ends with
a half cadence in the style typical of the late eighteenth century: it leaps
directly from ➀ to ➄ instead of relying on the standard bass, and it includes a
trill on ➌.
