The first half of this movement begins with a Romanesca–Prinner. Only in the
second and third variations does the Prinner have a ➏–➎–➍–➌ melody; in the
theme and fourth variation the Prinner has ➊ instead of ➎, and in the first
variation the Prinner contains just the first two scale degrees.

The Second Theme resembles a Meyer. However, a key characteristic of the Meyer
is tonal stability (Gjerdingen 2007, 112) and this passage modulates: the first
dyad contains ➀–➁ in the dominant and the second dyad contains ➆–➀ in the
tonic.
