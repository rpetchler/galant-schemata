My favorite part of this movement occurs at the end of the __A__ section of the
binary form. The arpeggiated diminished seventh (vi{{< sup "o7" >}}) feels
unstable; the arpeggiated dominant seventh (V{{< sup "7" >}}) prepares a
cadence to the tonic (I). The legato Prinners that follow feel like relief but
contain a surprise. The first Prinner is complete: it is an instance of the
variant with a canon on ➏–➎–➍–➌ in the melody and bass, and features a pedal
point on ➀. The second Prinner, however, is evaded: it begins by repeating ➍–➌
in the melody against ➅–➄ in the bass, but the bass moves unexpectedly to ♯➃
and dashes any relief the listener may feel.
