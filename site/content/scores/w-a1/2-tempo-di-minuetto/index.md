This movement contains a few noteworth schemata. The Do-Re-Mi lacks the 1-7-1
bass but occurs in a round. A Quiescenza begins the second half, and is
followed by an Ascending Hexachord in the dominant containing an embedded
Fenaroli in the tonic.

My favorite part of this movement is the Fenaroli / Comma:

The Fenaroli is the riposte to the opening theme. It lacks a pedal point on âž„
but the chords in the first beat of each measure create a similar effect. The
embedded Comma reinforces a pre-cadential effect; in the first half a
modulating Converging Half Cadence follows and in the second half an Authentic
Cadence follows.
